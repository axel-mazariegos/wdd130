            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>It all began with a shared love for nature and adventure. In 2010, we decided to turn a passion for rafting into a way of life. Having spent countless summers navigating the rivers of California, we realized that rafting wasn’t just a hobby—it was a way to connect with the wild, push personal limits, and build unforgettable memories. <br>

                What started as small, informal trips with friends quickly grew as word spread about our ability to craft thrilling yet safe experiences. By 2020, the vision for White Water Rafting came to life: a professional rafting company dedicated to providing exceptional outdoor adventures for thrill-seekers, families, and explorers alike.<br>
                
                From our humble beginnings with just a few rafts and a handful of dedicated guides, White Water Rafting has since grown into a trusted name in rafting tours in Californi. Despite our growth, our values have remained the same—prioritizing safety, environmental respect, and delivering unparalleled adventure.<br>
                
                Today, White Water Rafting is proud to offer a range of rafting experiences, from serene family-friendly floats to adrenaline-pumping whitewater challenges. We continue to operate with the same passion and respect for nature that inspired us from the start, striving to introduce more people to the joy of conquering the river, while maintaining a commitment to sustainable and responsible tourism.</p>
